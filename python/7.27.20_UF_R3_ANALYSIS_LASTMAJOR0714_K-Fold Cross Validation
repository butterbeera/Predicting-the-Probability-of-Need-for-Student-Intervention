Cross Validation for Random Forest
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

Y = df['STUDENT_SUCCESSNO']
X = df.drop(['STUDENT_SUCCESSNO'], axis= 1)
RF = RandomForestClassifier()
scores = cross_val_score(RF, X, Y, cv=5)
scores

Cross Validation for KNN
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, recall_score, f1_score
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier as kNN

model = kNN(n_neighbors = 3, algorithm='auto', weights='distance')
Y = df['STUDENT_SUCCESSNO']
X = df.drop(['STUDENT_SUCCESSNO'], axis= 1)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, Y, cv=5)
scores
